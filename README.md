# BaseConversion
This repository is more of a test of my skills rather then something practical to use. This shows of my understanding of conversion to hexadecimal or other bases, however this algorithm does not work with all bases. This only will work when base is based on a binary logic, such as hexadecimal. Every four bits represents a character, and thus has 16 different characters (2 ^ 4 = 16). Bases like base10 or base9 do not rely on the binary and thus is not compatible with the main algorithm, however, one can easily override the encode and decode code to achieve this.
